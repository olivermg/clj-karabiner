A Clojure library that provides some custom data structures that I found to be helpful.

Sure, you can build your own data structures on top of maps, vectors etc., but in many cases that
means you also have to provide custom functions like my=, my-assoc, my-dissoc, my-merge etc.

The custom data structures here provide special features but still allow you to make use
of Clojure's native functions (as long as this makes sense).


## Data Types

The following Data Types exist:

* **relevancemap**:
  A map that lets you define which of its properties should influence its hash value.

* **transactionmap**:
  A map that keeps track of changes and provides means by which you can commit or
  roll back these changes.

* **lazyvector**:
  A vector that treats its contents lazily. It will only `deref` these contents when
  necessary.

* **lazymap**:
  A map that treats its contents lazily. It will only `deref` its contents when necessary.

* **dbmap**:
  A map that combines **relevancemap**, **transactionmap** and **lazyvector** into one single
  type that is suitable for representing database records. Additionally, it makes a distinction
  between the entity's own properties vs. references to other entities.


## Criticizm appreciated

Some features of these custom datatypes may not (yet) be consistent with Clojure's paradigm of
how it handles data types.

However, I'll try to minimize the discrepancies, if there are any. I'll be very thankful for
any kind of feedback, hints and tips for how to make this library better! If you find
there are issues that should be improved, fixed or should not be done at all, just drop
me a line - I appreciate that.


## Usage

Still alpha! Examples will follow.
