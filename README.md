[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/olivermg/clj-karabiner.png)](http://travis-ci.org/olivermg/clj-karabiner)

A Clojure library that provides some custom data structures that I found to be helpful.

Sure, you can build your own data structures on top of maps etc., but in many cases that
means you also have to provide custom functions like =, assoc, dissoc, merge etc.

The custom data structures here provide special features but still allow you to make use
of Clojure's native functions (as long as this makes sense).
